The Sun is the largest object in the Solar System [4].   It contains more than 99% of the system’s mass [12].  

Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun [2]. Venus is similar in size to Earth but has a thick, toxic atmosphere [8].  

Earth is the only planet known to support life [5].   Mars is called the Red Planet because of its iron oxide surface [17].  

Jupiter is the largest planet [3].   Saturn is famous for its beautiful rings [19].  

Uranus rotates on its side compared to other planets [21].   Neptune is known for its strong winds and storms [9].  

Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006 [7].   The asteroid belt lies between Mars and Jupiter [15].  

Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt [20].   Comets are icy bodies that develop tails when near the Sun [6].  

The Kuiper Belt lies beyond Neptune [18].   The Oort Cloud is a theoretical shell of icy bodies [23].  

The Sun produces energy through nuclear fusion [1].   It fuses hydrogen into helium in its core [11].  

The Sun’s outer atmosphere is called the corona [10].   Solar flares release bursts of energy [16].  

The solar wind is a stream of charged particles [14].   Mercury has almost no atmosphere [27].  

A day on Mercury is longer than its year [25].   Venus has surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead [13].  

Earth has one natural satellite, the Moon [24].   The Moon causes tides on Earth [22].  

Mars has the tallest volcano, Olympus Mons [26].   Mars also has the largest canyon, Valles Marineris [28].  

Jupiter has a giant storm called the Great Red Spot [29].   Jupiter has at least 79 moons [30].  

Saturn’s moon Titan has a thick atmosphere [2].   Uranus has a faint ring system [8].  

Neptune’s moon Triton orbits in the opposite direction [19].   Pluto has five known moons [6].  

The Solar System formed about 4.6 billion years ago [12].   The planets orbit the Sun in elliptical paths [3].  

Kepler’s laws describe planetary motion [25].   Gravity keeps the planets in orbit [9].  

The Sun will eventually expand into a red giant [15].   Later, it will shrink into a white dwarf [11].  

Mercury’s surface is covered in craters [22].   Venus rotates very slowly [14].  

A day on Venus is longer than its year [20].   Earth’s atmosphere protects it from harmful radiation [18].  

The Moon has no atmosphere [17].   Mars has polar ice caps [21].  

Water once flowed on Mars [24].   Jupiter emits more heat than it receives [28].  

Saturn’s rings are made of ice and rock [26].   Uranus was discovered by William Herschel [7].  

Neptune was discovered in 1846 [5].   The dwarf planet Eris is larger than Pluto [27].  

Comets originate from the Kuiper Belt or Oort Cloud [30].   Halley’s Comet is visible from Earth every 76 years [10].  

Asteroids are rocky remnants from the early Solar System [29].   Meteoroids are small rocks traveling through space [6].  

If a meteoroid enters Earth’s atmosphere, it becomes a meteor [2].   If it survives the fall, it becomes a meteorite [12].  

The Sun’s gravity dominates the Solar System [15].   Planetary orbits are nearly on the same plane [3].  

This plane is called the ecliptic [19].   The Milky Way galaxy contains billions of stars [22].  

Our Solar System orbits the center of the Milky Way [9].   One orbit takes about 225 million years [23].  

The Voyager probes have left the Solar System [18].   New Horizons visited Pluto in 2015 [14].  

Spacecraft use gravity assists to travel faster [20].   Telescopes help us study distant objects [11].  

The Hubble Space Telescope orbits Earth [25].   James Webb Space Telescope launched in 2021 [30].  

Exoplanets are planets beyond our Solar System [6].   Thousands of exoplanets have been discovered [2].  

Some exoplanets orbit in the habitable zone [28].   Stars form in giant clouds of gas and dust [26].  

These regions are called nebulae [16].   Supernovae occur when massive stars explode [19].  

Supernovae spread heavy elements across space [21].   Black holes form from collapsed massive stars [10].  

The Sun will not become a black hole [3].   Instead, it will end as a white dwarf [12].  

The Solar System has eight planets [8].   There are five recognized dwarf planets [27].  

Moons vary greatly in size and composition [29].   Ganymede is the largest moon in the Solar System [4].  

Europa may have a subsurface ocean [15].   Enceladus ejects plumes of water into space [23].  

Triton may also have a subsurface ocean [13].   The Kuiper Belt contains many icy bodies [17].  

Beyond the Kuiper Belt lies the scattered disk [20].   The Oort Cloud may extend halfway to the nearest star [30].  

Solar eclipses occur when the Moon blocks the Sun [22].   Lunar eclipses happen when Earth blocks sunlight [9].  

Eclipses helped prove the theory of relativity [18].   Ancient civilizations studied the stars and planets [11].  

Astronomy is one of the oldest sciences [5].   The heliocentric model was proposed by Copernicus [25].  

Galileo supported the heliocentric model [14].   Newton explained gravity and planetary motion [28].  

Space exploration began in the 20th century [7].   Humans first landed on the Moon in 1969 [2].  

Robotic missions explore planets and moons [16].   Rovers study the Martian surface [6].  

Perseverance rover landed on Mars in 2021 [24].   The ISS is a laboratory in space [21].  

Astronauts conduct experiments in microgravity [12].   Space telescopes observe in different wavelengths [30].  

Infrared telescopes detect heat [8].   Radio telescopes detect cosmic signals [29].  

Gamma-ray bursts are the most energetic events [23].   The universe is expanding [17].  

Dark matter makes up most of the universe’s mass [9].   Dark energy causes accelerated expansion [19].  

Our Solar System is just one of billions in the galaxy [13].   Life may exist elsewhere in the universe [5].
