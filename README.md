# Semantics

Learning and experimenting with semantics in Machine Learning. A touch of web development included.

Welcome to the Semantics repository! This project serves as a sandbox for exploring semantic techniques in machine learning, with a particular focus on natural language processing (NLP) and embeddings. It also integrates elements of web development to create interactive applications.

ðŸš€ Project Overview:
The Semantics project is designed to:

Experiment with semantic representations: Dive into the world of embeddings and their applications in machine learning.

Develop interactive web applications: Utilize frameworks like Flask to build user-friendly interfaces that showcase semantic models.

Process and analyze data: Implement scripts for data preprocessing and embedding computation to prepare datasets for machine learning tasks.


ðŸ§° Features:
Data Preprocessing: Scripts to clean and prepare datasets for semantic analysis.

Embedding Computation: Tools to generate and utilize embeddings for various applications.

Web Interface: A basic web application to interact with the semantic models and visualize results.
